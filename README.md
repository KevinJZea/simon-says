# Simon Says

Go and take a look here! -> **[Link](http://kevinjzea.com/simon-says/index.html)**

Simon Says is a game where the computer (Simon) will tell you a sequence of colors you should follow. If you follow the sequence correctly, you will win the round. Each one of the rounds will turn into a more difficult sequence to follow. Once you win a _n_ number of rounds, you will win the game.

The three HTML, CSS and JavaScript are added to the same index.html file. Nonetheless, in the folder _components_, you'll see each one of the files that were created for the game in its extension.

### Have fun!

P.S. This game was created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript Vanilla (no frameworks nor libraries extra).
